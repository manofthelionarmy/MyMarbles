Aliases: refer to the same file with multiple names in different contexts or alternate names.

The alias section must be placed at the very top of the note to take effect, hence why it's at the top.

Link with aliases
--
Once you've set aliases for a file, you can write `[[aliases]]` to link to the original page. 

The `!` will make the link appear or inject the content of the document at that link
![[Hello world]]

Ex:

The `|` it will replace the title of the link 
[[Hello world | World Hello]] 



Find unlinked mentions
--
After you've set aliases for a note, you can find unlinked mentions by both it's name and it's aliases.
